This repository contains scripts used to perform Genome Wide Association Study using genotyping data collected from Alzheimer patients in Kazakhstan. The genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium ImmunoArray-24 v2.0 that contains ~253,702 SNPs, including Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Germline variants, Structural variants, Insertions-deletions (indels), and Copy number variants (CNVs). 

Originally, 288 patients were samples. During quality control, 108 patients were removed due to missing phenotypic or genotyping data, or due to not being of kazakh ethnicity. Of the remaining 180 patiets, 92 are cases, and 88 are controls.
