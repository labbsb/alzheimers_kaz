This repository contains scripts used to perform Genome Wide Association Study using genotyping data collected from Alzheimer patients in Kazakhstan. The genotyping was performed using Illumina Infinium ImmunoArray-24 v2.0 that contains ~253,702 SNPs, including Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Germline variants, Structural variants, Insertions-deletions (indels), and Copy number variants (CNVs). 

Originally, 264 patients were samples. During quality control, 95 patients were removed due to missing phenotypic or genotyping data, or due to not being of kazakh ethnicity. Of the remaining 169 patiets, 93 are cases, and 76 are controls.
